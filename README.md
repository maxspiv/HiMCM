# HiMCM
Code and paper written for the 2022 HiMCM Math Modeling Challenge in which [my team won the top prize internationally](https://www.contest.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2022results.html) (shared with 3 teams from the U.S. and 5 from China). Uses differential equations to model the dynamics of population of a bee colony over time, including the dynamics that result from the everyday decisions made by the bee population.

**Max_S_HiMCM.ipynb** contains all the code written by me for the 2022 HiMCM competition. The code uses PyTorch to propagate daily dynamics over time while retaining sensitivities to the parameters that determine these dynamics.<br>
**HiMCM_13405_Paper.pdf** is the paper I wrote alongside my team (13405) for the 2022 HiMCM competition.
